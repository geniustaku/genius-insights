## Next Steps After Tracking

### Weekly Review

3. Look for trends (which topics are growing?)

### Monthly Actions
1. **Top Performers:** Update and expand your most-visited articles
2. **Create Similar Content:** Write new articles on related topics to your top articles
3. **Low Performers:** Either improve SEO or remove/consolidate
4. **Promote Winners:** Share your popular articles on social media

### Content Strategy
Based on analytics, you can:
- **Write more articles** on topics that get the most visits
- **Update popular articles** with more detail and current information
- **Create tools/calculators** related to your most popular articles
- **Focus SEO efforts** on content types that perform well

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. When a user visits a tracked page, the `usePageVisit` hook fires
2. It sends a request to `/api/analytics/track` with the page path
3. The API increments the count in Firestore collection `pageVisits`
4. Admin dashboard fetches data from `/api/analytics/stats`
5. Data is displayed with rankings and visualizations

### Data Stored
For each page, Firestore stores:
```javascript
{
  path: "/articles/sars-tax-guide",
  count: 1250,
  firstVisit: Timestamp,
  lastVisit: Timestamp
}
```

### Privacy
‚úÖ **Only tracks:** Page path and visit count
‚ùå **Does NOT track:** IP addresses, user info, devices, locations, cookies

## Adding More Pages to Track

To track additional pages, add the hook to any client component:

```tsx
'use client';
import { usePageVisit } from '@/hooks/usePageVisit';

export default function MyPage() {
  usePageVisit('/my-page-path');

  return <div>Content</div>;
}
```

## Firestore Structure

```
pageVisits/
‚îú‚îÄ home/                         (path: "/")
‚îú‚îÄ document-converter/           (path: "/document-converter")
‚îú‚îÄ tools/                        (path: "/tools")
‚îú‚îÄ articles/                     (path: "/articles")
‚îú‚îÄ articles_sars-tax-guide/      (path: "/articles/sars-tax-guide")
‚îú‚îÄ articles_property-transfer/   (path: "/articles/property-transfer")
‚îî‚îÄ ... (all your other articles will appear here)
```

## Important Notes

1. **Every article is tracked separately** - This is intentional! It helps you see which specific content performs best.

2. **Visit counts are cumulative** - They increase over time, showing you long-term popular content.

3. **Check regularly** - Weekly or monthly reviews will help you spot trends and make better content decisions.

4. **Focus on high performers** - Your top 10-20 pages are where you should focus most of your effort.

5. **Use insights for strategy** - Let the data guide your content creation, not just gut feeling.
