- This will be your primary communication channel
- SARS sends ALL correspondence here
- Use an email you check regularly
- Format: yourname@example.com

**Best Practice:** Use a personal email, not work email (in case you change jobs).

**Confirm Email Address:**

- System checks both entries match

**Cellphone Number:**

- Format: 0821234567
- Used for SMS notifications
- Required for OTP (One-Time PIN) security

**Alternative Contact Number (Optional):**

### Step 8: Residential and Postal Addresses

**Physical/Residential Address:**

- Cannot use someone else's account
- Joint accounts: use primary account holder name

**Verification:**
- SARS may verify account via small test deposit
- Check your account is active and not frozen

**Security Note:** Your banking details are encrypted and secure. SARS never asks for PIN or OTP codes.

### Step 10: Security Questions Setup

**Purpose:** Additional security for password resets and account recovery.

**You'll Set Three Security Questions:**

**Examples of Questions:**
- What is your mother's maiden name?

**Choosing Strong Answers:**
- Select questions you'll definitely remember
- Don't use easily guessable information (avoid public social media details)
- Answers are case-sensitive
- Write them down in a secure place

**Best Practice:** Use unique answers not posted on social media. If your mother's maiden name is on Facebook, that's not secure.

- Rental income
- Foreign income

**Consequence:** SARS will catch this and assess additional tax plus penalties

**Solution:** Declare ALL income, no matter how small

### Mistake 2: Missing Deductions

**Commonly Forgotten:**
- Retirement contributions
- Medical expenses beyond medical aid
- Donations with Section 18A certificates
- Home office expenses
- Travel logbook claims

**Cost:** Overpaying tax by thousands

**Solution:** Review our [Tax Deductions Guide](https://www.genius-insights.co.za/south-africa-income-tax-deductions-guide) annually

**Problem:** Wrong account number or closed account

**Consequence:** Refund delayed by months

**Solution:**
- Verify banking details before submission
- Update immediately if changed
- Confirm account is active

### Mistake 4: No Supporting Documents

**Problem:** Claiming deductions without receipts

**Consequence:** SARS disallows deductions in audit

**Solution:**

**Issue:** Only includes IRP5 income; no deductions

**Solution:**

- File full return if you have deductions to claim
- Can increase refund significantly

### Mistake 7: Amending Returns Incorrectly

**Problem:** Making errors in amended returns

**Consequence:** Further complications and delays
