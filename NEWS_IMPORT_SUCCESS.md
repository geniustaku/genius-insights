## 💡 Tips

### 1. Run During Peak News Times

Best times to find SA news:
- **Morning (6-9 AM)** - Overnight news
- **Midday (12-2 PM)** - Business news
- **Evening (5-7 PM)** - Market close news

### 2. Adjust Search Queries

Based on your analytics, focus on topics that perform well:
- If banking articles get lots of views → add more fintech queries
- If property is popular → add real estate queries

### 3. Monitor Quality

Check imported articles occasionally to ensure:
- Content is relevant to SA
- Categories are accurate
- Images are appropriate
- Source attribution is working

### 4. Handle Duplicates

The system prevents duplicate URLs, but if you want to prevent duplicate titles:

```javascript
// Add to transformArticle function
// Check if article with similar title exists
```
